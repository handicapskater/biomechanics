<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Introduction</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA) is a federal law that prohibits discrimination against individuals with
disabilities in various areas of life, including employment (Title I),
government services and programs (Title II), public accommodations and
commercial facilities (Title III), and miscellaneous provisions (Title V).
However, despite these legal protections, individuals with disabilities
continue to face systemic discrimination in many aspects of their lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>One example of this discrimination
can be seen in the treatment of individuals who use non-traditional mobility
aids, such as inline skates, to navigate their environment. Even though these
aids may be necessary for individuals with a ballistic mobility impairment<a
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>[2]</span></span></span></a>,
they are often stigmatized and not recognized as valid accommodations under the
ADA. This has resulted in me being denied access to employment (AirBnB),
government services and programs (Public Transportation), public accommodations
(Airlines, Housing, Shopping, Workout, …), and receiving coerced or threatening
behavior (Public Transportation, San Mateo Police Department, CA-DMV, Government,
…).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>This essay is the public exploration
of the issues of systemic discrimination across ADA Titles I, II, III, and V,
specifically as it relates to individuals who use inline skates as a mobility
aid, such as myself. I will demonstrate how this systemic discrimination has
forced me to actively pursue civil disobedience to affect change in these
instances.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>History</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>In 1991, I dawned inline skates and
immediately knew that my ability to ambulate was dramatically increased, while
reducing pain and set forth in a scientific experiment. For over 10-years, I
would enter a business establishment where they would say you are not allowed,
and I would mimic the walking motion with skates as shoes. Businesses either
let me in or did not know how to interpret this, whereby if they denied me, I
took my business elsewhere. During this time, I was a prolific skater on a regional
recreation area, Coyote Point, developing my skating double push technique. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>In 1997, I obtained a handicap
plate on a motorcycle, because I had lost 2-jobs having to park and walk
distances that were too far. This allowed me to park close enough to walk into
work. Shortly thereafter, I sold my car with a manual transmission for an
automatic transmission, because the process of pushing the clutch in caused too
much pain. Also, at this time, I moved to apartments that were on the 1<sup>st</sup>
floor or had elevator access. My condition had worsened, and I started living
near CalTrain in anticipation of gaining access with my mobility aid to
establish my climate duty to reduce carbon emissions by utilizing skates and
public transportation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>CalTrain and other public transit entities continued to refuse
service to me using inline skates as a mobility aid. That led to me learning to
ride a motorcycle with skates to get to jobs, since public transportation was
not viable, and they provided no reasonable accommodation. My mantra became:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>In 2004, I found it necessary to
use Civil Disobedience #1 to get my case heard. I notified CalTrain that I was
going to board with my inline skates, where I was trying to get them to comply.
They started case 904405, against using inline skates on public transportation,
where I was found innocent. Shortly thereafter, I filmed this incident with
CalTrain showing their rampant disregard for the disabled<a href="#_ftn3"
name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>[3]</span></span></span></a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>In 2005, I petitioned the San Francisco
International Airport (SFO) to allow me to use inline skates as a mobility aid
to ambulate around for flights<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>[4]</span></span></span></a>.
This proved to be very advantageous, because on one flight transfer in Greensboro,
I was able to skate through the airport faster than others using a golf cart to
catch my next flight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>In 2006, I submitted an ADA
complaint to the US Department of Justice (US-DOJ), where they mandated the US
Department of Transportation Federal Transit Administration (US-DOT-FTA) provide
a reasonable accommodation for non-access<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>[5]</span></span></span></a>.
It was not until March of 2007, when BART was forced to provide paratransit<a
href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>[6]</span></span></span></a>.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>In 2009, a SMPD Officer Sgt Collum
pulled me over for a traffic infraction and asked about my usage of skates on a
motorcycle. He accepted my explanation and allowed me to proceed riding with
skates after writing a citation for a different traffic infraction. There are numerous
other incidents with Police Departments and CHP, when facing my mobility aid where
they complied with ADA laws.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;page-break-after:avoid'><img width=279 height=208
src="WhyIRideAMotorcycleWithSkates.fld/image002.gif" align=left hspace=12>At
this point in 2010, 27 years after my injury, I found the Doctor who identified
Hip Impingement Syndrome in my left hip joint. Up to this point, no one had
identified bone spurs on my hip joint and there was no definitive proof, just
my observations of acute and chronic pains. I had surgery, which helped but in
no way corrected my problems and skates were still necessary for my injury. At
this time, I went back home for a High School reunion only to be subjected to
the TSA leaving me with 5 bins strewn around while trying to re-pack my backpack
and reattach my mobility aid. The TSA has adjusted giving me an appropriate reasonable
accommodation, since this incident. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>However, airlines have been squirrelly
about it with the culmination in 2013, where United Airlines made me change
seats to the terrorist seat and told me that I could not get up during the 3-hour
flight even to use the restroom. I have not flown since this humiliating and discriminating
incident. <b>This is a major reason for this article, so I can fly to see my
family without being harassed.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>In 2013, Chesapeake Pointe
Apartments, gave me a 30-day eviction notice, because they were renovating my
apartment. Being disabled, a 30-day notice is insufficient to find appropriate
housing and I found it necessary again to use Civil Disobedience #2. This led
to me going to court on an unlawful detainer charge, where I was given 90-days
to find appropriate housing. During this process a Palo Alto judge excoriated
me for being in the courtroom with my mobility aid, which adversely affected my
case even though I had set a precedent in 2005.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>In 2017, as a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu
(BJJ) practitioner, I petitioned several tournament organizers about their
practice of starting the match standing and periodically being stood up during
a match. It is very painful walking and being stood up when it is much easier
for me to roll around on the ground grappling. I will be petitioning to get my
black belt with a handicap blue colored band to indicate that I am disabled and
need a reasonable accommodation for standing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I have worked with Cisco Systems, Visa,
Zynga, and JobTrain<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>[7]</span></span></span></a>
among others to obtain reasonable accommodations for gainful employment. However,
in 2019 AirBnB through Accenture and EverythingD suspended me making me work
remotely, pre-pandemic, mandating that I work from home after a dog tried to
bite me, because they falsely accused my mobility aid as being unsafe without
any evidence. During this time, I was not included in meetings and did not have
enough time to acclimate to several team members’ foreign speech dialects while
on-site; it was untenable to contribute causing me to find other employment. I
submitted a complaint to the DFEH, but they did a haphazard review accepting this
discrimination<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>[8]</span></span></span></a>.
This is troublesome, because in 2004 I petitioned the DFEH for public transit
access, where their haphazard review also accepted discrimination. However, my
Civil Disobedience #1 and petition to the DOJ gave me paratransit access countering
the 2004 DFEH ruling. The DFEH is demonstrating ADA Title V systemic discrimination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            In
2022, a San Mateo Police Officer, Julio Jolivette, falsely accused me of not
having control of my motorcycle, while riding with skates after 15 years of
doing it successfully. This officer’s superior, Sgt Collum as described earlier,
pulled me over in 2009 allowing it. The DMV then suspended my license on false
pretenses and relegated me to skating everywhere, where I documented it with a
wearable fitness tracker as wheelchair pushing. I had to write a 13-page legal
pleading with 130-pages of exhibits that changed the DMV’s mind, because no lawyers
were capable<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>[9]</span></span></span></a>.
After several tests demonstrating rampant discrimination, I was re-issued a
license and my driving record was updated with the provision:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>This gives rise to ADA Title II
complaints against Bart, CalTrain, SamTrans and the DOT. It also gives rise to
ADA Title V complaints against the SMPD, CA-DMV and their CA-DMV ADA division. I
had to implore Civil Disobedience #3 to allow me to ride down to a DMV motorcycle
lollipop course on a suspended license to practice, repeatedly<a href="#_ftn10"
name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>[10]</span></span></span></a>.
Then, Civil Disobedience #4 to rent a car with a suspended license to pass the
DMV driving course. The DMV refused my reasonable accommodations and were clueless
in the understanding of my disability and the braking mechanics of a motorcycle,
i.e., the front vs back brake. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Legal Argument</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>In the ADA Requirements:
Wheelchairs, Mobility Aids, and Other Power-Driven Mobility Devices (OPDMD)<a
href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>[11]</span></span></span></a>,
it clearly states that people with disabilities have the right to choose
whatever mobility device best suits their needs. For instance, inline skates are
necessary for my ballistic mobility impairment<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>[12]</span></span></span></a>.
Riding a motorcycle with skates is necessary since Public Transportation
refuses access with inline skates and has refused an alternative such as paratransit
since 1991. In the OPDMD, it states that:</p>
