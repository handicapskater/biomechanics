We have contacted representatives of the <script>d.write(window.ada)</script> and they do not classify handicap devices, but rather say it depends on an individual's need.
Our patient has a Doctors prescription to <b>"Rollerblade for Handicap"</b>, thus establishing his need. Furthermore, he has another doctor
stating that skates are <b>"medically necessary for his ballistic mobility impairment"</b>.

<p></p>
The following organizations have enacted discriminatory practices against him:
<p></p>

    <td>SamTrans</td>
    <td>In 2001, he contacted SamTrans accessibility specialist, <a href="mailto:siegerm@samtrans.com?subject=HandicapSkater&cc=handicapskater@mindspring.com&body=You are practicing blatant discrimination and need to review your policies.">Mathew Sieger</a> (650) 508-6202, after an accident
to facilitate his ability to get to the doctor. But, Mr. Sieger refused his use of in-line skates suggesting
"SamTrans management would be open to allowing [him] to wear his roller blades if he were in a
wheelchair or power scooter. He would then be free to use the roller blades at the various stores from which he has
received permission for roller-blading. I would think that use of a wheelchair or scooter would save him from many jolts [<script>d.write(window.impactShock)</script>s] as well".

use his mobility aid, because the BART Lawyers had reviewed his case and cited California Penal Code Section 640(b)(10), stating
skates are illegal in BART facilities. Then, Mr. Goldstrom states "it is not discrimination to deny access to an individual with
disabilities if that individual engages in illegal conduct."

	Upon pressing him Mr. Wong stated that "reasonable" is whatever he feels. He then asked a question "If a pair of skates were specifically
	designed for the Handicapped would you accept them?" and Mr. Wong refused outright.
