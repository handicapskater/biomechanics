Brinckmann, et. al (p. 69) report that healthy people perform several million steps per year and the hip joint has adapted to this
repetitive cycle. These stresses then propogate through the pelvic girdle and its <script>d.write(top.kinematicChain)</script>. Throughout the years, our patient has adapted
in many ways to facilitate his ability to survive in this society. Since 1998, he has moved to apartments that have an elevator because he
can no longer continue walking up stairs. Walking has become an activity that he must limit, due to his <b>mobility impairment</b>.

This <script>d.write(top.kinematics)</script> model demonstrates the process of walking which causes a significant amount of vertical pelvic displacement.
Each time our patient's foot strikes a surface there are two <script>d.write(top.impactShock)</script>s of between <b>4</b> <script>d.write(top.bw)</script>-<b>7</b> <script>d.write(top.bw)</script> that is put on the
hip joints and propogates through the lumbo-sacro-pelvic system.

This model shows the ballistic motion of walking from a side-view perspective to demonstrate the
twisting of the pelvis between the upper and lower body. Also, you can see the impact of the heel as it strikes the ground due to
gravity pulling the foot down and forward by <script>d.write(top.g)</script>, enabling a horizontal and vertical force component.  A sustained
compression <script>d.write(top.force)</script> of <b>3</b> <script>d.write(top.bw)</script> flows through your lumbo-sacro-pelvic region.
