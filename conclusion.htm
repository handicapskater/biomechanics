	<td colspan="2">This comparison illustrates the difference between ballistic and non-ballistic human movement by exploring the <span id="impactShock"></span>. Since skating exploits a horizontal <span id="force"></span> it reduces the compression on the hips by up to <b>1,350 lbs</b> (<b>6&frac34;</b> <span id="bw"></span>). That is a compressive <span id="force"></span> <b>28 times</b> greater from walking than skating.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><br />Brinckmann, et al. (p. 69) discuss a hip in a healthy person being able to handle repetitive loads of one hundred thousand to several million steps a year. A step consists of 2 <span id="impactShock"></span>s, thus a healthy individual can handle two hundred thousand to six million <span id="impactShock"></span>s a year. The hip joints primary function is to support the <span id="hat"></span> while standing, walking, running and stair climbing (Norkin and Levangie, p. 301). The pubic symphysis is a weight-bearing joint that is responsible for transmitting and withstanding these <span id="force"></span>s (Norkin and Levangie, p. 61). The joints in the pelvis and legs act as a <span id="kinematicChain"></span> during standing with the feet on the ground fixed and the legs fixed to the pelvis. Changes in the structure or function of any of these joints causes a change in the other joints of the chain resulting in functional changes (stress/pain) adjacent to or at a joint further along in the chain (Norkin and Levangie, p. 69-70).<br /><br />Hamill and Knutzen (p. 9) report through <span id="kinetics"></span> anlaysis that high-impact aerobics causes injury to 43% of participating individuals, but 76% of the instructors suffer injury. They found that high-impact aerobics causes injury to the musculoskeletal system with <span id="force"></span>s in the range of <b>4-5</b> <span id="bw"></span>. The repeated exposure of these forces contributes to these injuries, so an average 200 lb man would suffer injuries with repeated exposure of <b>800-1000 lbs</b> or <b>3,560-4,450 N</b>.</td>

	<td colspan="2">In these models, we can see that walking is accomplished by the upper torso (arms) twising one way, the lower torso (legs) twisting the opposite way.

Brinckmann, et al. (p. 77) report the latest findings on hip joint <span id="Load"></span> by the seminal work of Bergmann (1989, 1997, 2001), who implanted specialized hip joints that report <span id="Load"></span>s. The results are categorized in order of severity as follows for a 200 lb man:<ol><li>Running, Walking Down Stairs and Fast walking all have a <b>5</b> <span id="bw"></span> compression <span id="force"></span> or a <b>1,000 lb</b> <span id="Load"></span>.</li><li>Slow Walking or Walking Up Stairs has a <b>3</b> <span id="bw"></span> compression <span id="force"></span> or a <b>600 lb</b> <span id="Load"></span>.</li><li>The Cycling motion has a <b>2<sup>2</sup>/<sub>5</sub></b> <span id="bw"></span> compression <span id="force"></span> or a <b>480 lb</b> <span id="Load"></span>.</li><li>Walking with 2 crutches has a <b>1&frac12;</b> <span id="bw"></span> compression <span id="force"></span> or a <b>300 lb</b> <span id="Load"></span>.</li><li>In a two-legged stance there is a maximum <span id="Load"></span> of <b><sup>4</sup>/<sub>5</sub></b> <span id="bw"></span>-<b>1</b> <span id="bw"></span> or between <b>160-200 lbs</b>.</li><li>A wheelchair has a <b><sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub></b> <span id="bw"></span> compression <span id="force"></span> or a <b>132 lb</b> <span id="Load"></span> on the <span id="siJoints"></span>, since it supports the <span id="hat"></span>.</li><li>A Cane increases the moment arm in the <span id="force"></span> calculation, thus reducing the <span id="Load"></span> to <b><sup>2</sup>/<sub>5</sub></b> <span id="bw"></span> or a <b>80 lb</b> <span id="Load"></span> reported by Norkin and Levangie (p. 328-30).</li><li>In the seminal work of Mahar, et. al, they studied <span id="impactShock"></span> with skates and reported a <b><sup>1</sup>/<sub>10</sub></b> <span id="bw"></span>-<b><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></b> <span id="bw"></span> compression <span id="force"></span> or a <b>20-50 lb</b> <span id="Load"></span> on our patient's hips, which does not target the <span id="siJoints"></span>.</li></ol>
