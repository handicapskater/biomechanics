	<td colspan="2">This comparison illustrates the difference between ballistic and non-ballistic human movement by exploring the <script>d.write(top.impactShock)</script>. Since skating exploits a horizontal <script>d.write(top.force)</script> it reduces the compression on the hips by up to <b>1,350 lbs</b> (<b>6&frac34;</b> <script>d.write(top.bw)</script>). That is a compressive <script>d.write(top.force)</script> <b>28 times</b> greater from walking than skating.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><br />Brinckmann, et al. (p. 69) discuss a hip in a healthy person being able to handle repetitive loads of one hundred thousand to several million steps a year. A step consists of 2 <script>d.write(top.impactShock)</script>s, thus a healthy individual can handle two hundred thousand to six million <script>d.write(top.impactShock)</script>s a year. The hip joints primary function is to support the <script>d.write(top.hat)</script> while standing, walking, running and stair climbing (Norkin and Levangie, p. 301). The pubic symphysis is a weight-bearing joint that is responsible for transmitting and withstanding these <script>d.write(top.force)</script>s (Norkin and Levangie, p. 61). The joints in the pelvis and legs act as a <script>d.write(top.kinematicChain)</script> during standing with the feet on the ground fixed and the legs fixed to the pelvis. Changes in the structure or function of any of these joints causes a change in the other joints of the chain resulting in functional changes (stress/pain) adjacent to or at a joint further along in the chain (Norkin and Levangie, p. 69-70).<br /><br />Hamill and Knutzen (p. 9) report through <script>d.write(top.kinetics)</script> anlaysis that high-impact aerobics causes injury to 43% of participating individuals, but 76% of the instructors suffer injury. They found that high-impact aerobics causes injury to the musculoskeletal system with <script>d.write(top.force)</script>s in the range of <b>4-5</b> <script>d.write(top.bw)</script>. The repeated exposure of these forces contributes to these injuries, so an average 200 lb man would suffer injuries with repeated exposure of <b>800-1000 lbs</b> or <b>3,560-4,450 N</b>.</td>

Biomechanical Analysis:</b> There are 3 areas to analyze:<ol><li>Subjective - Our subject has been using skates for <script>d.write(top.yearsOfSkating)</script> years as a common wheelchair. The last <script>d.write(top.yearsOfDocumenting)</script> years has been documented within private and public businesses.</li><li>Objective - Mahar, et. al, report an impact force between <b><sup>1</sup>/<sub>10</sub></b> <script>d.write(top.bw)</script>-<b><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></b> <script>d.write(top.bw)</script>. These tests used a uni-axial (single direction) accelerometer to measure impact accelerations which were resolved into impact forces.</li><li>Predictive - This site contains numerous biomechanical models demonstrating the <script>d.write(top.kinematics)</script> of walking and skating.</li></ol>
