	<h2>Advocacy for Mobility Aid Recognition</h2>
</header>
<main>
	<section id="introduction">
		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>
			Welcome to the advocacy page dedicated to raising awareness and support for the recognition of unique
			mobility aids, specifically the use of inline skates. My name is Troy Wilkes, and I have spent over a
			decade refining the use of skates as a vital mobility aid to manage my ballistic mobility impairment
			before addressing the legal challenges of their acceptance.
		</p>

	<section id="samtrans-incident">
		<h3>SamTrans Incident</h3>
		<p>
			After years of successfully using skates as a mobility aid, I reached out to SamTrans to ensure proper
			accommodation. Unfortunately, SamTrans engaged in disinformation, resulting in a prolonged struggle for
			recognition. Despite these challenges, I continued to advocate for my rights and the rights of others with
			similar needs.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section id="legal-precedent">
		<h3>Legal Precedents</h3>
		<p>
			Through persistent efforts, I set a legal precedent in San Mateo Superior Court, affirming the right to use
			skates as a mobility aid. Additionally, I established the precedent of riding a motorcycle with skates, a
			practice I had safely maintained for over 18 years before my license was wrongfully suspended due
			to police disinformation.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section id="data-science">
		<h3>Data Science Proof</h3>
		<p>
			The necessity of using skates as a mobility aid is backed by comprehensive data science. My research
			demonstrates significant differences in heart rate and pain levels between walking and skating. This
			evidence highlights the critical need for skates in managing my condition and underscores the importance
			of proper accommodation.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section id="discrimination">
		<h3>Discrimination and the Need for Identification</h3>
		<p>
			Despite the clear evidence and legal precedents, myself and others continue to face discrimination
			regarding our mobility aids. To address this, it is imperative that mobility aids like skates be
			identified on a driver's license. This would facilitate easier verification and support, ensuring that
			individuals with unique mobility needs receive the accommodations they deserve. I am now <strong>DMV
			certified to ride a motorcycle with skates</strong>, however my driver's license has a <strong>restriction
			of 50 (RSTR 50) on the front</strong> as an indirect reference to contact the DMV for verification.

		<h4>Due to Systemc Discrimination the validation needs to be on the license to spontaneously vindicate one's
			mobility aid usage for locomotion in business and operating vehicles.</h4>
			I am proposing that a handicap symbol be displayed on the front of a driver's license indicating a
			disability, where the back indicates whether they need a mobility aid for locomotion and or driving:

			<strong>HANDICAP: Use skate prostheses for locomotion and driving</strong>

	<section id="civil-rights-complaint">
		<h3>Civil Rights Complaint</h3>
		<p>
			In 2006, I filed a Civil Rights complaint with the Department of Justice, which led to the US DOT-FTA
			being mandated to evaluate reasonable accommodations temporarily granting Paratransit. Despite this, I have
			been denied access to public transportation since 1991, underscoring the ongoing struggle for recognition
			and equality.

		<h3>Call to Action</h3>
		<p>
			Join me in advocating for the recognition and accommodation of unique mobility aids. Your support is
			crucial in raising awareness, influencing policy changes, and ensuring that individuals like myself can
			live with dignity and independence.
