	<h2>Advocacy for Mobility Aid Recognition</h2>
</header>
<main>
	<section id="introduction">
		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>
			Welcome to the advocacy page dedicated to raising awareness and support for the recognition of unique
			mobility aids, specifically the use of inline skates. My name is Troy Wilkes, and I have spent over a `
			decade refining the use of skates as a vital mobility aid to manage my ballistic mobility impairment
			before addressing the legal challenges of their acceptance.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section id="samtrans-incident">
		<h3>SamTrans Incident</h3>
		<p>
			After years of successfully using skates as a mobility aid, I reached out to SamTrans to ensure proper
			accommodation. Unfortunately, SamTrans engaged in disinformation, resulting in a prolonged struggle for
			recognition. Despite these challenges, I continued to advocate for my rights and the rights of others with
			similar needs.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section id="legal-precedent">
		<h3>Legal Precedents</h3>
		<p>
			Through persistent efforts, I set a legal precedent in San Mateo Superior Court, affirming the right to use
			skates as a mobility aid. Additionally, I established the precedent of riding a motorcycle with skates, a
			practice I had safely maintained for over 18 years before my license was wrongfully suspended due
			to police disinformation.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section id="data-science">
		<h3>Data Science Proof</h3>
		<p>
			The necessity of using skates as a mobility aid is backed by comprehensive data science. My research
			demonstrates significant differences in heart rate and pain levels between walking and skating. This
			evidence highlights the critical need for skates in managing my condition and underscores the importance
			of proper accommodation.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section id="discrimination">
		<h3>Discrimination and the Need for Identification</h3>
		<p>
			Despite the clear evidence and legal precedents, myself and others continue to face discrimination
			regarding our mobility aids. To address this, it is imperative that mobility aids like skates be
			identified on a driver's license. This would facilitate easier verification and support, ensuring that
			individuals with unique mobility needs receive the accommodations they deserve. I am now <strong>DMV
			certified to ride a motorcycle with skates</strong>, however my driver's license has a <strong>restriction
			of 50 (RSTR 50) on the front</strong> as an indirect reference to contact the DMV for verification.

			<h4>
				Due to Systemc Discrimination the validation needs to be on the license to spontaneously vindicate one's
				mobility aid usage for locomotion in business and operating vehicles.
			</h4>
			I am proposing that a handicap symbol be displayed on the front of a driver's license indicating a
			disability, where the back indicates whether they need a mobility aid for locomotion and or driving:
			<br />
			<strong>HANDICAP: Use skate prostheses for locomotion and driving</strong>

		<h3>Civil Rights Complaints</h3>
		<p>
			In 2006, I filed a Civil Rights complaint with the Department of Justice, which led to the US Department of
			Transportation: Federal Transit Administration being advised to evaluate reasonable accommodations. They
			used disinformation leading to a temporary grant of Paratransit. After
			<script>document.write(new Date().getFullYear() - 2006)</script> years, I am still under a temporary grant
			of Paratransit, underscoring the ongoing struggle for recognition and equality.
		</p>
		<p>
			In 2022, my license was suspended during the pandemic after a San Mateo Police Department Officer and the
			DMV used disinformation again despite my established legal right to use skates as a mobility aid. By
			spreading disinformation and suspending my license, the authorities have not only violated my rights but
			also impeded my ability to work and contribute to society. I seek recognition of this unfair treatment and a
			restoration of my rights to use skates as a necessary mobility aid, as legally established and consistently
			demonstrated through my actions. <br />
			<strong>A new Civil Rights Complaint is currently being written to establish equitable disability
			rights.</strong>

			live with dignity and independence.
