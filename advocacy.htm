	<h1>Advocacy for Mobility Aid Recognition</h1>
</header>
<main>
	<section id="introduction">
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Welcome to the advocacy page dedicated to raising awareness and support for the recognition of unique mobility aids, specifically the use of inline skates. My name is [Your Name], and I have spent over a decade refining the use of skates as a vital mobility aid to manage my ballistic mobility impairment.</p>
	</section>

	<section id="samtrans-incident">
		<h2>SamTrans Incident</h2>
		<p>After years of successfully using skates as a mobility aid, I reached out to SamTrans to ensure proper accommodation. Unfortunately, SamTrans engaged in disinformation, resulting in a prolonged struggle for recognition. Despite these challenges, I continued to advocate for my rights and the rights of others with similar needs.</p>
	</section>

	<section id="legal-precedent">
		<h2>Legal Precedents</h2>
		<p>Through persistent efforts, I set a legal precedent in San Mateo Superior Court, affirming the right to use skates as a mobility aid. Additionally, I established the precedent of riding a motorcycle with skates, a practice I had safely maintained for over 18 years. This was necessitated after my license was wrongfully suspended due to police disinformation.</p>

	<section id="data-science">
		<h2>Data Science Proof</h2>
		<p>The necessity of using skates as a mobility aid is backed by comprehensive data science. My research demonstrates significant differences in heart rate and pain levels between walking and skating. This evidence highlights the critical need for skates in managing my condition and underscores the importance of proper accommodation.</p>
	</section>

	<section id="discrimination">
		<h2>Discrimination and the Need for Identification</h2>
		<p>Despite the clear evidence and legal precedents, myself and others continue to face discrimination regarding our mobility aids. To address this, it is imperative that mobility aids like skates be identified on driver's licenses. This would facilitate easier verification and support, ensuring that individuals with unique mobility needs receive the accommodations they deserve.</p>
	</section>

	<section id="civil-rights-complaint">
		<h2>Civil Rights Complaint</h2>
		<p>In 2006, I filed a Civil Rights complaint with the Department of Justice, which led to the US DOT-FTA being mandated to evaluate reasonable accommodations. Despite this, I have been denied access to public transportation since 1991, underscoring the ongoing struggle for recognition and equality.</p>

	<section id="call-to-action">
		<h2>Call to Action</h2>
		<p>Join me in advocating for the recognition and accommodation of unique mobility aids. Your support is crucial in raising awareness, influencing policy changes, and ensuring that individuals like myself can live with dignity and independence.</p>
