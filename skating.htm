Skating reduces your impact force to <b><sup>1</sup>/<sub>10</sub></b> <script>d.write(top.bw)</script>-<b><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></b> <script>d.write(top.bw)</script> as reported by Mahar, et. al. This likely happens since there is no "flight phase" during
skating and you apply <script>d.write(top.force)</script>s almost entirely in a horizontal direction. This differs from walking, which has both a horizontal and
vertical <script>d.write(top.force)</script> component.

This <script>d.write(top.kinematics)</script> model demonstrates non-ballistic motion from a side-view perspective for skating. There are
several observations:
<ol>
	<li>The pelvis is at an angle with the legs, creating a shock absorber.</li>
	<li>The knees are also at an angle, creating another shock absorber.</li>
	<li>At the base of the spine, where the <script>d.write(top.siJoints)</script> connect the sacrum to the pelvis, there is no torsion or intra-pelvic torsion.</li>
	<li>There is a reduction in the gravitational force, because the foot is not falling forward.</li>
	<li>Momentum is transfered between strides, thus easing the force necessary to propel forward.</li>
</ol>
