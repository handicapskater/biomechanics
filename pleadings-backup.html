      <h4>Discrimination Summary</h4>
      <p>Over two decades, government and private entities have repeatedly denied equal access to the user despite medical necessity and legal precedent. Discrimination has spanned transportation, housing, employment, and court access, violating ADA Titles I, II, III, and V.</p>

          Filed a Civil Rights Complaint against the DOT, after they refused access, the DOJ ultimately pressured the DOT for ParaTransit as a reasonable accommodation.

          RULING: <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/regulations-and-guidance/civil-rights-ada/bay-area-rapid-transit-district-san-francisco-ca-10-15-07" target="_blank">DOT-FTA Ruling Granting Me ParaTransit Access With Skates</a>
          <br /><br />
          Since 2007, I have relied on ParaTransit as a reasonable accommodation for my mobility disability. That year, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) determined that while transit agencies could prohibit the use of roller skates on platforms and vehicles, they could not ban their use in concourse areas or external facilities, as the agency failed to establish that such use posed a direct threat in those environments.
          <br /><br />
          Despite this precedent, the current transit authorities are violating this reasonable accommodation. I am now pursuing legal recourse on the grounds that the 2007 interpretation misrepresented key biomechanical facts. Their continued refusal to accommodate my mobility aid results in the use of cutaway buses and prolonged ride durations, which exacerbate my injuries and cause undue physical harm.        </td>
