In 1999, our patient started having major difficulty walking, while still being able to skate with ease. Since then, he has
successfully petitioned many organizations to allow him access on skates according to the <span id="ada"></span>,
whereby he provides a standard agreement for access including:
<ol>
	<li>Displaying a <a href="common/images/HandicapSkates.gif" target="_blank">handicap sticker on the outside of each skate</a> to facilitate recognition by an organization's staff.
	<li>A release of "all" liability agreement with the organization.
	<li>Displaying a badge and/or presenting documentation upon inquiry by the staff of an organization.
	<li>Conducting himself in a professional manner.
	<li>Agreeing that a wheelchair standard of access is appropriate for skates, ie. a <span id="commonWheelchair"></span>.
	<li>He has insurance to cover skating mishaps, while handicap skating.
	<li>Some organizations request that he contact them in advance to notify their staff.
</ol>
