Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Biomedical Research Scientist position on the Meta Health and Wellbeing team. With extensive experience in biomedical research, data analysis, and advocating for accessibility, I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to your team’s mission of improving health outcomes globally.

I founded HandicapSkater Biomechanics to explore and document the impact of ballistic versus non-ballistic motion on my pelvic deformity, maintaining my health and wellness through innovative approaches. My work has led to significant legal precedents, including DMV certification for riding a motorcycle and driving a car with skates, showcasing my ability to push boundaries and achieve practical solutions for accessibility.

My expertise aligns well with the responsibilities of this role:

1.  Biomedical Sensors and Data Analysis: I have extensive experience working with biomedical sensors and systems to collect and analyze physiological data. My personal data collection using WHOOP and Strava has been instrumental in documenting Pain-Induced Cardiovascular Events (PICE), highlighting my ability to handle time series multimodal data.
2.  Signal Processing and Data Visualization: I have developed and implemented signal processing, data analysis, and visualization techniques, leveraging my understanding of physiology and statistical methods. My work includes setting up ML operations, data analysis, and engineering pipelines to provide evidence of pain and its impact on cardiovascular health.
3.  Research and Development: My hands-on experience in designing and executing studies, as well as developing standard operating procedures for data collection, aligns with the role’s requirements. I have validated algorithms and models for biomedical applications, ensuring their accuracy and reliability.
4.  Programming and Software Development: Proficient in Python, I have written reusable and well-documented code for various biomedical research projects. My experience with TensorFlow, Numpy, and Pandas further supports my ability to develop specialized software tools for biomedical measurement data.
5.  Collaboration and Interdisciplinary Work: My career demonstrates success in working within and across multidisciplinary teams, including project managers, software engineers, and data scientists. I thrive in fast-paced environments, consistently executing projects with precision and passion.

Throughout my career, I have utilized advanced statistical software and techniques to derive meaningful insights from research data, contributing to the development of actionable inferences and conclusions. My advocacy for accessibility, combined with my technical skills and research experience, makes me a unique and valuable candidate for the Biomedical Research Scientist position.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background, skills, and experiences align with the goals of the Meta Health and Wellbeing team.

Sincerely,
Troy Wilkes
