	<h1>Understanding Chronic vs. Acute Pain and Mobility</h1>

	<div class="section">
		<h2>Chronic vs. Acute Pain</h2>
		<p><strong>Acute Pain:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Typically lasts less than three months.</li>
			<li><strong>Onset:</strong> Sudden and usually linked to a specific event (e.g., surgery, injury).</li>
			<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Acts as a warning signal, indicating something is wrong and needs immediate attention.</li>
			<li><strong>Resolution:</strong> Generally resolves with treatment or healing of the underlying cause.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Chronic Pain:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Lasts more than three months and can persist even after the initial injury or illness has healed.</li>
			<li><strong>Onset:</strong> Gradual, may not have a clear trigger, and can result from a combination of factors.</li>
			<li><strong>Impact:</strong> Persistent pain that can significantly affect various aspects of life, including physical functioning, mental health, and overall quality of life.</li>
			<li><strong>Management:</strong> Requires a comprehensive, multimodal approach addressing both physical and psychological aspects.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Impact on Mobility</h2>
		<p><strong>Walking:</strong></p>
		<p>Walking, especially with a pelvic deformity causing extreme pain, likely triggers a chronic pain response. This results in:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Elevated Heart Rate:</strong> Pain and physical exertion increase your heart rate significantly, often reaching 180+ bpm. This is due to the body's stress response, activating the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and increasing cardiovascular strain.</li>
			<li><strong>Reduced Mobility:</strong> Chronic pain and elevated heart rate from walking can limit your activity levels and exacerbate pain.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Skating:</strong></p>
		<p>Skating, being a non-weight-bearing activity, can help manage your pain better by:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Lower Heart Rate:</strong> Allows for physical activity while keeping your heart rate below 160 bpm, reducing stress on your cardiovascular system.</li>
			<li><strong>Pain Management:</strong> Skating reduces the load on painful joints and deformities, preventing the exacerbation of chronic pain and allowing for more extended, less painful activity.</li>
		</ul>

	<div class="section">
		<h2>Visualizing and Analyzing Data</h2>
		<p>Using tools like WHOOP and Strava, you can collect and analyze data to support these points:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Heart Rate Trends:</strong> Track your heart rate during walking and skating sessions. Note the higher peaks during walking and more stable rates during skating.</li>
			<li><strong>HRV Measurements:</strong> Record HRV before and after activities. Lower HRV after walking compared to skating indicates higher stress and pain levels.</li>
			<li><strong>Activity Logs:</strong> Document pain levels and activity limitations. Correlate higher pain scores and reduced activity with walking versus increased activity with skating.</li>
		</ul>
