		<h3>Chronic vs. Acute Pain</h3>
		<p><strong>Acute Pain:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Typically lasts less than three months.</li>
			<li><strong>Onset:</strong> Sudden and usually linked to a specific event (e.g., surgery, injury).</li>
			<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Acts as a warning signal, indicating something is wrong and needs immediate attention.</li>
			<li><strong>Resolution:</strong> Generally resolves with treatment or healing of the underlying cause.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Chronic Pain:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Lasts more than three months and can persist even after the initial injury or illness has healed.</li>
			<li><strong>Onset:</strong> Gradual, may not have a clear trigger, and can result from a combination of factors.</li>
			<li><strong>Impact:</strong> Persistent pain that can significantly affect various aspects of life, including physical functioning, mental health, and overall quality of life.</li>
			<li><strong>Management:</strong> Requires a comprehensive, multimodal approach addressing both physical and psychological aspects.</li>

		<h3>Pain-Induced Cardiovascular Event</h3>
		<p><strong>PICE:</strong></p>
		<p>
			A Pain-Induced Cardiovascular Event (PICE) refers to a physiological response where the experience of pain
			triggers significant changes in cardiovascular metrics such as heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), and
			possibly blood pressure. This concept is based on the understanding that pain, particularly chronic or
			severe pain, can elicit a strong response from the autonomic nervous system made up of the sympathetic and
			parasympathetic nervous systems, leading to noticeable cardiovascular effects. It is an important concept in
			understanding the physiological impact of pain on the cardiovascular system providing a measurable way to
			assess the severity and impact of pain on an individual, enabling better management and treatment of
			pain-related conditions.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Heart Rate (HR):</strong> Pain can cause an increase in heart rate as part of the bodyâ€™s stress
				response. This is mediated by the autonomic nervous system, particularly through the activation of the
				sympathetic nervous system.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Heart Rate Variability (HRV):</strong> HRV, which measures the variation in time between
				heartbeats, can be influenced by pain. Typically, pain can reduce HRV, indicating increased sympathetic
				and reduced parasympathetic activity.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Blood Pressure:</strong> Pain may also lead to changes in blood pressure, though this can vary
				depending on the individual and the nature of the pain.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS)</strong></p>
		<p>
			The SNS prepares the body for the "fight or flight" response during stressful situations by increasing HR,
			dilating bronchial passages, decreasing motility of the large intestine, constricting blood vessels,
			dilating pupils, and causing perspiration.
			<br />
			Mechanisms:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Heart Rate (HR):</strong> The SNS releases norepinephrine which binds to beta-adrenergic
				receptors in the heart, increasing the rate and force of heart contractions.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Energy Mobilization:</strong> It stimulates the release of glucose from energy stores and
				increases blood flow to skeletal muscles, allowing the body to react quickly to stress.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Parasympathetic Nervous System (PSNS)</strong></p>
		<p>
			The PSNS promotes the "rest and digest" response, conserving energy and replenishing the body's resources. It
			decreases HR, increases intestinal and glandular activities, and relaxes sphincter muscles in the
			gastrointestinal tract.
			<br />
			Mechanisms:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Heart Rate (HR):</strong> The PSNS releases acetylcholine which binds to muscarinic receptors in
				the heart, decreasing heart rate.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Digestive Process:</strong> It stimulates digestive enzyme secretion and peristalsis, aiding in
				digestion and nutrient absorption.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Applications in Data Science and Health Monitoring:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Identification and Monitoring:</strong> PICE can be used to identify episodes of significant
				pain in patients, especially those with chronic pain conditions. Wearable devices like WHOOP and
				platforms like Strava can track HR and HRV to detect these events.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Pain Management:</strong> Skating reduces the load on painful joints and deformities, preventing
				the exacerbation of chronic pain and allowing for more extended, less painful activity.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Personalized Healthcare:</strong> Understanding the patterns of PICE in an individual can help
				in personalizing pain management and treatment strategies. Continuous monitoring can provide insights
				into the effectiveness of interventions and the need for adjustments.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Research:</strong> PICE can be a valuable metric in clinical research to study the relationship
				between pain and cardiovascular health. It can help in understanding how chronic pain affects overall
				health and in developing new therapeutic approaches.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Impact on Mobility</h3>
		<p><strong>Walking:</strong></p>
		<p>Walking, especially with a pelvic deformity causing extreme pain, likely triggers a chronic pain response. This results in:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Elevated Heart Rate:</strong> Pain and physical exertion increase your heart rate significantly, often reaching 180+ bpm. This is due to the body's stress response, activating the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and increasing cardiovascular strain.</li>
			<li><strong>Reduced Mobility:</strong> Chronic pain and elevated heart rate from walking can limit your activity levels and exacerbate pain.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Skating:</strong></p>
		<p>Skating, being a non-weight-bearing activity, can help manage your pain better by:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Lower Heart Rate:</strong> Allows for physical activity while keeping your heart rate below 160 bpm, reducing stress on your cardiovascular system.</li>
			<li><strong>Pain Management:</strong> Skating reduces the load on painful joints and deformities, preventing the exacerbation of chronic pain and allowing for more extended, less painful activity.</li>

		<h3>Visualizing and Analyzing Data</h3>
		<p>Using tools like WHOOP and Strava, you can collect and analyze data to support these points:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Heart Rate Trends:</strong> Track your heart rate during walking and skating sessions. Note the higher peaks during walking and more stable rates during skating.</li>
			<li><strong>HRV Measurements:</strong> Record HRV before and after activities. Lower HRV after walking compared to skating indicates higher stress and pain levels.</li>
			<li><strong>Activity Logs:</strong> Document pain levels and activity limitations. Correlate higher pain scores and reduced activity with walking versus increased activity with skating.</li>
		</ul>
