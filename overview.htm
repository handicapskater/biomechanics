		Welcome to <strong>HandicapSkater.com</strong>, a platform dedicated to sharing my journey and advocating for the recognition and accommodation of unique mobility needs. My name is Troy Wilkes, and I live with a ballistic mobility impairment that makes walking a source of severe pain and potential Pain-Induced Cardiovascular Events (PICE). Through extensive biomechanical analysis and data science, I have found that inline skating provides a pain-free and effective way to manage my condition.
	</p>
	<h3>The Purpose of This Site:</h3>
	<ol>
		<li><b>Educate:</b> Provide detailed information about the biomechanics behind my disability and how traditional walking triggers debilitating pain.</li>
		<li><b>Present Evidence:</b> Share data science findings that highlight the significant differences in heart rate and pain levels between walking and skating, proving the necessity of using skates as a mobility aid.</li>
		<li><b>Advocate:</b> Call for legal recognition and accommodation of mobility needs, including the inclusion of a disability moniker on a driver's license to facilitate easier verification and support for the disabled.</li>
		<li><b>Inspire Action:</b> Encourage visitors to support the disabled by raising awareness and contacting relevant authorities to advocate for disability equality and accommodations.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Legal Precedents</h3>
	<p>Over the years, several legal precedents have been set that recognize the rights of individuals with disabilities and the necessity of reasonable accommodations:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><b>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA):</b> The ADA ensures that individuals with disabilities have equal access to public facilities and services. My condition falls under this protection, as my mobility aid is essential for my daily life and health.</li>
		<li><b>Department of Justice (DOJ) Rulings:</b> I have sought and obtained rulings from the DOJ to support my case, affirming that my use of skates as a mobility aid is a legitimate and protected accommodation.</li>
		<li><b>Case Law:</b> Various court cases have established that reasonable accommodations must be made for individuals with disabilities, including the use of non-traditional mobility aids when they are necessary for the individual's health and well-being.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Combining the Biomechanics, Data Science, and Legal Foundations</h3>
	<p>This site integrates biomechanical analysis, data science, and legal precedents to form a comprehensive case for the necessity of my mobility aid and more specifically a spontaneous way to judge a person's disability. The evidence presented here demonstrates that:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Biomechanics:</b> Walking triggers severe pain and PICE, while skating provides a pain-free alternative.</li>
		<li><b>Data Science:</b> Statistical analyses confirm the significant differences in pain and heart rate levels between walking and skating.</li>
		<li><b>Legal Precedents:</b> Legal frameworks and rulings support the necessity of accommodating my unique mobility needs.</li>
	</ul>
	<p style="font-size: 1.2em;">
		Thank you for visiting <strong>HandicapSkater.com</strong>. Your support is crucial in helping to ensure that individuals with unique mobility needs receive the recognition and accommodation they deserve.
