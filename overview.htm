	<h3>Disability Science: Pioneering Thought Evolution for Health and Equality</h3>
	<p style="font-size: 1.2em;">
		Humans have evolved as a biological species over millions of years. Yet, our most significant leap has been
		through thought processes that surpass any other known species. For example, we developed material sciences to
		create cars—requiring not only their design and construction but also the cognitive understanding of how to
		operate them safely in a shared environment. Similarly, HandicapSkater is a service designed to leverage AI and
		human ingenuity to enhance our collective thought evolution, focusing on improving health and equality through
		preventative measures and systemic reform.
	</p>
	<h4>A New Evolutionary Step: Skating as Mobility Innovation</h4>
	<p style="font-size: 1.2em;">
		Walking, though essential, places significant stress on the feet, ankles, knees, pelvis, and back. These
		ballistic stresses accumulate with age, leading to degeneration and mobility challenges. Just as the wheel
		represented a revolutionary leap in human movement, skating or the skating motion offers an evolutionary
		improvement, alleviating these stresses while fostering better health. While not everyone may adapt to skating,
		the biomechanics and insights gained from it are universally relevant to human ambulation and mobility.
	</p>>
	<h4>A Vision for Health and Equality</h4>
	<p style="font-size: 1.2em;">
		The first legal step in this movement is to establish a moniker (or emoji) on driver’s licenses, indicating a
		person’s disability status. The reverse side would include a brief text description certifying their mobility
		aid use. This simple addition would have alleviated many of the barriers I have faced over the past 20 years
		using skates as my mobility aid, paving the way for greater inclusivity and understanding.
	</p>
	<h4>Data Privacy and Insight Through Technology</h4>
	<p style="font-size: 1.2em;">
		The HandicapSkater system will secure a users’ data, ensuring transparency by allowing  users to see who
		accesses their information. Anonymized data will be analyzed for insights, evolving knowledge to benefit
		humanity. The core system integrates a hybrid AI approach that will enable us to uncover preventative health
		measures, enhance mobility, and promote equality.
	</p>
	<h4>Incentives for Data Participation</h4>
	<p style="font-size: 1.2em;">
		Users will be incentivized to share data—such as pictures of meals, ingredients—by receiving better health
		diagnostics. The system prioritizes prevention, challenging a medical paradigm that often profits from treatment
		rather than long-term health maintenance. For example, my use of disability science:
		<ul>
			<li>
				Identifying that walking caused Pain-Induced Cardiovascular Events (PICE) led me to adopt skating as a
				low-impact mobility aid.
			</li>
			<li>
				Recognizing hypothyroidism linked to stress and posture issues prompted me to use yoga and long weekly
				skates for drug-free regulation.
			</li>
			<li>
				Changing my diet to address fatty liver symptoms and improved digestion.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<h4>Civil Disobedience and Personal Advocacy</h4>
	<p style="font-size: 1.2em;">
		Through a series of civil disobedience actions, I have demonstrated the value of these insights:
		<ol>
			<li>
				Securing ParaTransit for physical therapy skating around San Francisco.
			</li>
			<li>
				Relocating to adequate housing after harassment and hypothyroidism recurrence.
			</li>
			<li>
				Continuing 12-mile skates around San Francisco during the pandemic despite lockdown restrictions.
			</li>
			<li>
				Writing legal pleadings to certify skates as a mobility aid and for driving after the DMV suspended my
				license.
			</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	<h4>A Future of Thought Evolution</h4>
	<p style="font-size: 1.2em;">
		HandicapSkater envisions a future where health is improved through thought evolution—leveraging data,
		biomechanics, and AI to empower individuals with preventative measures. By addressing systemic discrimination,
		the platform advances equality, making critical health insights accessible to all. This initiative will not only
		reduce the cost of illness but also enrich humanity’s collective understanding of health and mobility.
	</p>
	<h4>Advocating for a Driver’s License Moniker</h4>
	<p style="font-size: 1.2em;">
		One key solution I’m advocating for is the inclusion of a moniker on a driver’s license for individuals who rely
		on mobility aids. This moniker, detailed on the back of the license, would indicate that a person can use their
		mobility aid for both ambulating and driving. This simple addition would protect individuals like me from
		discrimination and ensure that we can maintain our independence without unnecessary challenges from authorities
		or institutions.
