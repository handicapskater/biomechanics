<h2 class="page-title">HandicapSkater: Evolution for Disability Rights</h2>

<h4>Driving and Ambulating with Prosthetic Skates</h4>
<p>
	Skates have been recognized on my driver’s license as a prosthetic mobility aid, allowing me to legally ride a
	motorcycle and drive a car. But this status is buried within DMV records and requires insider knowledge to find.
	My driver's license has a <strong>restriction 	of 50 (RSTR 50) on the front</strong> as an indirect reference to
	contact the DMV for verification that is untenable outside the state.

<p>
	Due to Systemc Discrimination the validation needs to be on the license to spontaneously vindicate one's
	mobility aid usage for locomotion in business and operating vehicles.
	I am proposing that a handicap symbol be displayed on the front of a driver's license instead of RSTR 50
	indicating a disability, where the back indicates whether they need a mobility aid for locomotion and or driving:
	<span class="license-text">
    HANDICAP: Ambulates and drives with prosthetic device skates.
	</span>
</p>

<p>This would help anyone using non-standard mobility aids—like skates, adaptive scooters, or wearable robotics—avoid confusion and discrimination from law enforcement, TSA, employers, and transit authorities.</p>

<h4>Why Skates? A New Form of Mobility</h4>
<p>Walking causes ballistic shock to the joints, especially for those with pelvic or back injuries. Skating
	dramatically reduces compressive impact, acting like a wheel for the body. It’s not just sport—it’s science.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Managing pain and mobility after multiple pelvic fractures and cracked sacroiliac joint</li>
	<li>Avoiding pain-induced cardiovascular events (PICE), such as walking</li>
	<li>Reversing hypothyroidism without medication</li>
	<li>Curing fatty liver by combining skating with nutrition</li>
</ul>

<h4>Data-Driven Disability Science</h4>
<p>HandicapSkater uses AI and biomechanics to analyze:</p>
<ul>
	<li>How skates reduce harmful impact, while conserving momentum</li>
	<li>Why HRV and cardiovascular data confirm safer mobility</li>
	<li>When systemic discrimination blocks necessary aids</li>
</ul>
<p>Your health data remains private but can fuel medical and legal breakthroughs for others through anonymized research.</p>

<h4>Legal Precedents and Civil Disobedience</h4>
<p>I’ve already forced change through:</p>
<ul>
	<li>San Mateo and San Francisco Superior Courts granting skate access in the courtroom as a reasonable accommodation</li>
	<li>Winning a 2007 DOT ruling to skate to physical therapy using ParaTransit</li>
	<li>Fighting the DMV’s suspension of my license—eventually reinstated for driving with skates</li>
	<li>Writing legal pleadings pro se to certify skating as a medical and legal necessity</li>
</ul>

<h4>Join the Movement</h4>
<p>Help us demand that DMV and federal authorities recognize prosthetic skates and non-standard mobility aids with
	a clear moniker and license description. It’s a small change that could protect thousands from systemic
	discrimination.</p>
