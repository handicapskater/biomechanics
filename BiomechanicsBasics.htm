The pelvic girdle supports the <script>d.write(top.hat)</script><span id="hat" class="def" onmouseover="return overlib('(Head, Arms and Trunk) Specifies the upper body including the head, arms and trunk.

During a normal walking pattern the upper half of the body rotates right, the lower half rotates left then vice-versa, meanwhile the pelvis is the hinge coordinating this movement.

Norkin and Levangie (p. 68) describe the function of <b>Joints</b> as the ability to establish stability in the human body and then to focus on providing mobility. In the pelvis, a <script>d.write(top.kinematicChain)</script><span id="kinematicChain" class="def" onmouseover="return overlib('A series of joints that movement in one joint causes movement in the other series of joints.', CAPTION, 'Closed Kinematic Chain', CENTER)" onmouseout="return nd()">closed kinematic chain</span> exists around the pelvic girdle. Minute movements involving the pelvis can cause stresses around the pelvic girdle. A <b>kinematic chain</b> produces a skill or movement through the combination of various joints and their degrees of freedom (Hamill and Knutzen, p. 25).
