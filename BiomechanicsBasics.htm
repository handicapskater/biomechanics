<h3>Pelvic Structure</h3>

	The pelvic girdle supports the <span id="hat"></span> and coordinates rotational movement of the upper and lower halves of the body. During a normal walking pattern the upper half of the body rotates right, the lower half rotates left then vice-versa, meanwhile the pelvis is the hinge coordinating this movement. The <span id="siJoints"></span> act as shock absorbers to absorb the <span id="impactShock"></span>s of each step as it flows through the lumbo-sacro-pelvic region.

<h3><span id="kinematicChain"></span></h3>

	Norkin and Levangie (p. 68) describe the function of <strong>Joints</strong> as the ability to establish stability in the human body and then to focus on providing mobility. In the pelvis, a <span id="kinematicChain"></span> exists around the pelvic girdle. Minute movements involving the pelvis can cause stresses around the pelvic girdle. A <strong>kinematic chain</strong> produces a skill or movement through the combination of various joints and their degrees of freedom (Hamill and Knutzen, p. 25).

	The <span id="linesOfForce"></span>, according to Norkin and Levangie (p. 311) and Lee (p. 61), describes how the <span id="hat"></span> creates a compression <span id="force"></span> on your <span id="siJoints"></span>, which permeates through the <span id="linesOfForce"></span> around the pelvis to the pubic symphysis and through the primary weight bearing area of the acetabulum to the femur.

<h3>Bilateral Stance</h3>
<p>
	Norkin and Levangie (p. 323–324) explain the Bilateral Stance and the compressive <span id="force"></span> on the hips. The <span id="hat"></span> is equal to <sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> <span id="bw"></span>. For a <strong>200 lb</strong> man he would experience a <strong>132 lb</strong> (<strong><sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub></strong> <span id="bw"></span>) compressive <span id="force"></span>, resulting in a <strong>66 lb</strong> (<strong><sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub></strong> <span id="bw"></span>) compressive <span id="force"></span> on each hip.
</p>

<h3>Unilateral Stance</h3>
<p>
	Norkin and Levangie (p. 324–326) explain the Unilateral Stance, the compressive <span id="force"></span> on the hips and the <span id="torque"></span> on the hips.<br />
	HAT = <sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> <span id="bw"></span><br />
	1 Leg = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>6</sub> <span id="bw"></span><br />
	For a 200 lb man, there would be a <strong>167 lbs</strong> (<sup>5</sup>/<sub>6</sub> <span id="bw"></span>) of compressive <span id="force"></span> on 1 leg due to gravity.<br />
	Since the stresses in the hips must be in equilibrium, as you take a step it creates a <span id="torque"></span> in 1 hip and a counter <span id="torque"></span> in the opposite hip. The supporting hip will have a <span id="torque"></span> of <strong>668 lb-in</strong> and the active hip will have a muscular joint compression <span id="force"></span> of <strong>334 lb</strong>. Therefore, the total hip joint compression during the unilateral stance is <strong>167 lbs</strong> of body weight compression plus <strong>334 lbs</strong> of muscular joint compression resulting in a total hip joint compression <span id="force"></span> of <strong>501 lbs</strong> (<strong>2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></strong> <span id="bw"></span>).

<h3>Lumbo-Sacro-Pelvic Movement</h3>

<p>
	Motion is described in terms of the 3 planes of motion: Frontal, Sagittal and Transverse. Pelvic motion can occur in all three planes and walking is one of the more complex human motions involving all 3 planes of movement. The pelvis tilts laterally in the Frontal Plane displacing the body's <span id="cog"></span>, which causes vertical displacement. The pelvis rotates in the Transverse Plane causing a torsion or twist putting stress on the <span id="siJoints"></span>. Lee (p. 70) describes Sagittal Plane motion with the ilium and sacrum having an intra-pelvic torsion.

	Nordin and Frankel (p. 448–449) discuss the sinusoidal displacement of the body's <span id="com"></span> within the pelvis in all 3 planes of movement, 3 cm vertically, 4 cm side-to-side and 2 cm front-to-back.

	Schneck and Bronzino (p. 155) discuss the low-efficiency of walking through the alteration of the lowering and raising of the <span id="com"></span>, while the feet provide the pushing and braking for movement. They liken walking to driving a car by alternately accelerating and applying the brakes.

<p>
	Nordin and Frankel (p. 266) suggest that Biomechanical Analysis demonstrates that the <span id="siJoints"></span> main function is to act as shock absorbers; with each hip joint supporting <strong><sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub></strong> <span id="bw"></span> (Lee, p. 61). Using a <span id="bw"></span> metric, studies have found that the <span id="Load"></span> on the hip joint for the male averages <strong>3</strong> <span id="bw"></span>, with a <strong>4</strong> <span id="bw"></span> on heel-strike and <strong>7</strong> <span id="bw"></span> prior to toe-off (Nordin and Frankel, p. 213), (Norkin and Levangie, p. 326), (Hamill and Knutzen, p. 41, 182). The body is caught at heel-strike, because the body is falling forward due to gravity causing a compression <span id="force"></span> of <strong>4</strong> <span id="bw"></span>. The body is pushed up and forward at toe-off, because the body is rising due to the <span id="torque"></span> of the lumbo-sacro-pelvic region, and initiates a <strong>7</strong> <span id="bw"></span> compression <span id="force"></span> on the hip joints.

	The Hip Joint can withstand <strong>12–15</strong> <span id="bw"></span> before it fractures and breakdown occurs in the osseous component (Hamill and Knutzen, p. 182). A healthy male has a <strong>7</strong> <span id="bw"></span> <span id="impactShock"></span> at toe-off with a <strong>5</strong> <span id="bw"></span> safety margin. The weight-bearing stresses on the Hip Joint are critical factors in the function and dysfunction of the Hip resulting in a <strong>kinematic chain</strong> with interactions and dependencies on the legs and spine (Norkin and Levangie, p. 301–302).

<h3>Biomechanical Analysis</h3>
<p>
	Marshall and Elliott describe the main functions of biomechanical analysis as:
<ol>
	<li>Subjective – observations made by a coach, doctor or subject; a qualitative measure. The cause and possible solutions of a problem are determined.</li>
	<li>Objective – use a <span id="metric"></span> to establish data representing an activity; a quantitative measure.</li>
	<li>Predictive – computer simulations that demonstrate <span id="kinematics"></span> and/or <span id="kinetics"></span> in human movement.</li>
</ol>
