<h3>Pelvic Structure</h3>

	The pelvic girdle supports the <span id="hat"></span> and coordinates rotational movement of the upper and lower halves of the body. During a normal walking pattern the upper half of the body rotates right, the lower half rotates left then vice-versa, meanwhile the pelvis is the hinge coordinating this movement. The <span id="siJoints"></span> act as shock absorbers to absorb the <span id="impactShock"></span>s of each step as it flows through the lumbo-sacro-pelvic region.

Norkin and Levangie (p. 68) describe the function of <b>Joints</b> as the ability to establish stability in the human body and then to focus on providing mobility. In the pelvis, a <span id="kinematicChain"></span> exists around the pelvic girdle. Minute movements involving the pelvis can cause stresses around the pelvic girdle. A <b>kinematic chain</b> produces a skill or movement through the combination of various joints and their degrees of freedom (Hamill and Knutzen, p. 25).<br /><br />The <span id="linesOfForce"></span>, according to Norkin and Levangie (p. 311) and Lee (p. 61), describes how the <span id="hat"></span> creates a compression <span id="force"></span> on your <span id="siJoints"></span>, which permeates through the <span id="linesOfForce"></span> around the pelvis to the pubic symphysis and through the primary weight bearing area of the acetabulum to the femur.

<h3>Bilateral Stance</h3><br />
Norkin and Levangie (p. 323-324) explain the Bilateral Stance and the compressive <span id="force"></span> on the hips. The <span id="hat"></span> is equal to <sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> <span id="bw"></span>. For a <b>200 lb</b> man he would experience a <b>132 lb</b> (<b><sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub></b> <span id="bw"></span>) compressive <span id="force"></span>, resulting in a <b>66 lb</b> (<b><sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub></b> <span id="bw"></span>) compressive <span id="force"></span> on each hip.
<p></p>
<h3>Unilateral Stance</h3><br />
Norkin and Levangie (p. 324-326) explain the Unilateral Stance, the compressive <span id="force"></span> on the hips and the <span id="torque"></span> on the hips. <br />HAT = <sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> <span id="bw"></span><br />1 Leg = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>6</sub> <span id="bw"></span><br />For a 200 lb man, there would be a <b>167 lbs</b> (<sup>5</sup>/<sub>6</sub> <span id="bw"></span>) of compressive <span id="force"></span> on 1 leg due to gravity.<br />Since the stresses in the hips must be in equilibrium, as you take a step it creates a <span id="torque"></span> in 1 hip and a counter <span id="torque"></span> in the opposite hip. The supporting hip will have a <span id="torque"></span> of <b>668 lb-in</b> and the active hip will have a muscular joint compression <span id="force"></span> of <b>334 lb</b>. Therefore, the total hip joint compression during the unilateral stance is <b>167 lbs</b> of body weight compression plus <b>334 lbs</b> of muscular joint compression resulting in a total hip joint compression <span id="force"></span> of <b>501 lbs</b> (<b>2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></b> <span id="bw"></span><br />).

<h3>Lumbo-Sacro-Pelvic Movement</h3>
<br />
<div id="walk-3d" style="text-align: center;"></div>
<script>imageLink("walk-3d", 'common/images/Skeleton-Walking-3D.gif', 'left');</script>
Motion is described in terms of the 3 planes of motion: Frontal, Sagittal and Transverse. Pelvic motion can occur in all three planes and walking is one of the more complex human motions involving all 3 planes of movement. The pelvis tilts laterally in the Frontal Plane displacing the body's <span id="cog"></span>, which causes vertical displacement. The pelvis rotates in the Transverse Plane causing a torsion or twist putting stress on the <span id="siJoints"></span>. Lee (p. 70) describes Sagittal Plane motion with the ilium and sacrum having an intra-pelvic torsion. The "Gait" or walking movement is expanded upon by Lee (p. 67-72), Norkin and Levangie (p. 448-493), Schneck and Bronzino (p. 131-139) and Nordin and Frankel (p. 439-456).<br />Nordin and Frankel (p. 448-449) discuss the sinusoidal displacement of the body's <span id="com"></span> within the pelvis in all 3 planes of movement, 3 cm vertically, 4 cm side-to-side and 2 cm front-to-back. <br clear="all" /><br />Schneck and Bronzino (p. 155) discuss the low-efficiency of walking through the alteration of the lowering and raising of the <span id="com"></span>, while the feet provide the pushing and braking for movement. They liken walking to driving a car by alternately accelerating and applying the brakes.

Nordin and Frankel (p. 266) suggest that Biomechanical Analysis demonstrates that the <span id="siJoints"></span> main function is to act as shock absorbers; with each hip joint supporting <b><sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub></b> <span id="bw"></span> (Lee, p. 61). Using a <span id="bw"></span> metric, studies have found that the <span id="Load"></span> on the hip joint for the male averages <b>3</b> <span id="bw"></span>, with a <b>4</b> <span id="bw"></span> on heel-strike and <b>7</b> <span id="bw"></span> prior to toe-off (Nordin and Frankel, p. 213), (Norkin and Levangie, p. 326), (Hamill and Knutzen, p. 41, 182). The body is caught at heel-strike, because the body is falling forward due to gravity causing a compression <span id="force"></span> of <b>4</b> <span id="bw"></span>. The body is pushed up and forward at toe-off, because the body is rising due to the <span id="torque"></span> of the lumbo-sacro-pelvic region, and initiates a <b>7</b> <span id="bw"></span> compression <span id="force"></span> on the hip joints. The upper body and lower body affect the <span id="siJoints"></span> and pelvis during movement, especially in ballistic activities such as running and walking (Norkin and Levangie, p. 158).<br />The Hip Joint can withstand <b>12</b> <span id="bw"></span> - <b>15</b> <span id="bw"></span> before it fractures and breakdown occurs in the osseous component (Hamill and Knutzen, p. 182). Structures designed by engineers adopt a safety factor of <b>5-10</b> times the normal stress (Hamill and Knutzen, p. 11). A healthy male has a <b>7</b> <span id="bw"></span> <span id="impactShock"></span> at toe-off with a <b>5</b> <span id="bw"></span> safety margin before the bone begins to breakdown at <b>12</b> <span id="bw"></span>. The weight bearing stresses on the Hip Joint are critical factors in the function and dysfunction of the Hip resulting in a <b>kinematic chain</b> with interactions and dependencies on the legs and spine (Norkin and Levangie, p. 301-302).

<h3>Biomechanical Analysis</h3>
<br />
Marshall and Elliott describe the main functions of biomechancial analysis as:<ol><li />Subjective - observations made by a coach, doctor or subject; a qualitative measure. The cause and possible solutions of a problem are determined.<li />Objective - use a <span id="metric"></span> to establish data representing an activity; a quantitative measure.<li />Predictive - computer simulations that demonstrate <span id="kinematics"></span> and/or <span id="kinetics"></span> in human movement.</ol>
